# UnoJohnnyBuildInfo

My first Arduino project. Goal is to visualize (TeamCity-) Buildinformation with a traffic light.

Arduino will not be used standalone, only serial-connected (USB/Bluetooth LE)  to PC / Mac. To be able to call the Rest-API of Teamcity I decided to create the program in Javascript and run it in an NodeJS-Environment. To connect to the Arduino UNO the Johnny-Five Lib will be used.

This project will be documented (in german) and discussed on my Blog: [csdev.it](http://csdev.it).
